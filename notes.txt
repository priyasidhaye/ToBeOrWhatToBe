Corpus notes 

* Bunch of books - project gutenberg
* Start with preprocessing corpus
 - Deal with different books
 - Different languages
 - Only consider sentences with "to be" in sentence
 - parse trees, dependency trees for subject->to be relations

* Unsupervised / supervised?
 - Supervised -> will have to extract the tagged data from the corpus, use in supervised learning/classification problem
 - Unsupervised -> generate bunch of features and throw at unsupervised learning model? Experiment with RNN/LSTM/Markov chain

* Possible features : 
 - subject properties : gender, number etc
 - sentence : can tense be extracted?
